# Instruction
- This is the MATLAB code of GD3N model for detecting selective forwarding attacks. For more info, please refer to the paper link (preprint): [GD3N: Detecting Selective Forwarding Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks under Variable Harsh Environments](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?)abstract_id=4538472).
- *Simulation.m* file conducts the main function of the whole model, while *GD_DBSCAN.m* file introduces the new DBSCAN data clustering algorithm.
